# rul-estimator-app
This project demonstrates a machine learning-based predictive maintenance system that estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines using NASAâ€™s CMAPSS dataset. The tool was built as an interactive Streamlit app, allowing users to test different models and simulate predictive alerts for early maintenance.
